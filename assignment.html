    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I attended a boarding school in Hershey Pa, for impoverished kids, <br> 
        from 6th-12th grade. At this school I got invested in working with my hands; <br>
        I did things such as construction, 3d printing, pottery and ceramics, and <br>
        I played 3 instruments. I play violin, viola and guitar(slightly). While I <br>
        did these things at the school, in my freetime I preferred playing video <br>
        games and hanging out with my friends. </p>
